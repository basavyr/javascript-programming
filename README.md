# JavaScript Programming
A repository for storing different implementations written in JS for multi-purpose programming.

This collection of `.js` files are organized in directories that focus on different issues, eg:
* Numerical programming
* Data analysis
* Physical calculations
* Data structures
* Asynchronous programming

and many more.

> Will get update (list) as other features are added.


This project was built on MacOS Catalina (10.15) and NodeJS latest version (as of June 2020).
